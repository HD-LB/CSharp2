using System;
//Write a program that shows the internal binary representation of given 32-bit signed floating-point number in IEEE 754 format(the C# type float).

//Input
//•On the only line you will receive a decimal number - N

//Output
//•Print the its binary representation on a single line ◦There should not be leading zeros


//Constraints
//•1 <= N <= 1019
//•Time limit: 0.1s
//•Memory limit: 16MB

//Example:


//number: -27.25

//sign: 1

//exponent: 10000011

//mantissa: 10110100000000000000000
