//So, being a KO-NE(Key Observation – Notification Expert), you really don't like the idea, that half the company you work for has started using a new method of messaging. This new method encrypts and encodes (compresses) the messages. Encoding is all well and good – company's saving on Broadband and all that jazz – but it's the encryption part you really have a problem with. After all, your job is "observation" and you really can't be effective at that when you can't even read the damn thing.
//Good thing is, being as good as you are, you found the source of the idea for the messaging system – some old article, describing a primitive but effective encoding and encryption algorithm.So much for security by obscurity.Here's the encryption and encoding algorithm description from the article:
//•	We are given a message and a cypher
//o The message is the text the user wants to transmit
//o  The cypher is a string which is used to encrypt and decrypt the message
//o  The encrypted message is called cypherText
//•	We define a function Encrypt, which takes a message and a cypher:
//o It iterates over the symbols in the message and the cypher
//o  For each pair of symbols, it takes their codes(in the table below) and computes the bitwise XOR of the symbol in the message with the symbol in the cypher.
//A  B C  D E  F G  H I  J K  L M  N O  P Q  R S  T U  V W  X Y  Z
//0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18	19	20	21	22	23	24	25
//o The resulting code is summed with the ASCII code of the character 'A' (65), giving a new ASCII code
//o The character corresponding to this new ASCII code is the encrypted representation of the respective character in the message
//o If the cypher string is shorter than the message, using it symbols loops to the beginning of the cypher.E.g. for a message "ABCDE" and a cypher "PQR" we will have:
//	'A' encrypted with 'P' = 'P', 'B' encrypted with 'Q' = 'R', 'C' encrypted with 'R' = 'T', 'D' encrypted with 'P' = 'M', 'E' encrypted with 'Q' = 'U'
//o If the message string is shorter than the cypher, some of its symbols will be encoded several times, until all of the cypher symbols are used.
//	E.g. for a message "ABC" and a cypher "PQRST", we will have:
//	'A' encrypted with 'P' and the result ('P') encrypted with 'S' = '^' (ASCII 94), 
//	'B' encrypted with 'Q' and the result('R') encrypted with 'T' = 'C',
//	'C' encrypted only with 'R' =  'T'
//•	We define a function Encode, which takes a string of text to compress:
//o It looks for sequences of symbols which are the same(e.g. 'aaaaa')
//o For each sequence of same symbols, the function replaces the sequence with a number representing the count of repeated symbols, followed immediately by the symbol which is repeated.This is called run-length encoding.E.g. for the text "aaaabbbccccaa" we will have "4a3b4caa".
//	The function replaces symbols in the aforementioned way ONLY if the run-length encoding of the same-symbol sequence is shorter than the sequence itself
//	That's why in the example above the last two a's remain the same – '2a' has the same length as 'aa'
//•	Given the two functions, and given a message and a cypher, the encrypted message should be:
//o Encode(Encrypt(message, cypher) + cypher) + lengthOfCypher
//	'+' denotes concatenation, the two functions return strings and 'lengthOfCypher' is a number, which is equal to the number of symbols in the cypher
//	i.e.the message is encrypted with the cypher, then the cipher is added for decrypting purposes, then the result is compressed and a number denoting the length of the cypher before compression is added to the compressed string
//Now, since you are very good, you know that the described Encrypt function actually works both ways – i.e. if something was encrypted with the function and a cypher, calling Encrypt again with the same cypher, but with the encrypted text, you will receive the original text.
//•	For example, Encrypt("ABCDE", "PQR") = "PRTMU" and Encrypt("PRTMU", "PQR") = "ABCDE"
//o Where the fist parameter of Encrypt is the message and the second is the cypher
//The Encode function is also relatively easy to reverse – just take the numbers and print the symbol after each number the corresponding … number … of times.

//Now all you have to do is put the pieces together and you can once again spy on the messaging in the company.
//Write a program, which by given an encrypted (with the above described method) message, recovers the original message
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console.
//On the only input line there will be the cyphered message
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described.There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output data should be printed on the console. Print exactly one line – the original message (decrypted and decoded)

//Input example :                 Output example:
//BKOXHI\EQOGX[YSOFTWARE8         TELERIKACADEMY
//ABBAA6BA7                       AAABB
//KKICXDE3P5                      JOHNY


//Constraints
//•	All symbols in the message will have ASCII codes in the range[65; 127]
//•	The original message for any encrypted message will always contain only capital English letters
//•	The original message will be no longer than 1500 symbols
//•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.Allowed memory: 16 MB.
